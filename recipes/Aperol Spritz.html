    <p>This refreshing Aperol spritz recipe is as gorgeous as it is beautiful. It’s the perfect way to unwind on a hot summer day.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <Li>Ice: Serve the Aperol spritz over ice. 
            </Li>
            <Li>Prosecco: You don’t have to use a top shelf Prosecco for this cocktail, but make sure your bottle is good quality. 
            </Li>
            <Li>Club soda: It wouldn’t be a “spritz” without bubbly club soda. 
            </Li>
            <Li>Aperol: Of course, you’ll need Aperol! You can use another bitter orange aperitif, if you like. 
            </Li>
            <Li>Orange: Garnish each Aperol spritz with an orange slice. 
            </Li>
        </ul>
